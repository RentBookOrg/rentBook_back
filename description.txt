This file is for myself to avoid confusion and conflicts, making single mistake twice while coding.

This project helps to sell or to rent books around the Uzbekistan based on sellers' location.
Because of delivery issues, buyers and sellers will be from one region. What does it mean?
For example, if seller is registered from Tashkent, the seller's books are only available for those who are 
in Tashkent.

However, I will try to add new features new steps but this is the only way to start the project.

In this project, only sellers are registered not buyers. We only collect buyers' informations and comments for 
statistics.

1-step. 
    Registeration

If someone wants to sell or rent their books, they should get registered. How can they do this?
When they enter our webpage, a model will be opened to get their location to show available books.
On the top right corner of the main page, will be a button to post someone's available books called 
"POST BOOK"

When button is pressed, registerd part is opened and the user should fill the form. If the user is already registered
the user should log in.

After filling the form, the user should do email verification to make sure this is a person.
If process of email verification is completed, i am not sure that the user should refresh the side or the process
may be automatically.

New form for book's info to get full information about the book.

Then, the book will be posted to be seen to all in the same location.
Token is stored on runtime variable. If the user close the tab token is cleaned (using page visibility api
to notice the action)
